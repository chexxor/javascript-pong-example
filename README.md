## JavaScript Pong Example

A Pong-like game using web browser Canvas implemented by following this guide: https://robots.thoughtbot.com/pong-clone-in-javascript

I was never able to figure out the physics and collision detection in my past attempts at implementing Pong, so following the guide was really helpful and motivating. Thanks, Matt Mongeau!

This was developed with intentions of porting to PureScript, for PureScript teaching purposes. That repo is https://github.com/chexxor/purescript-pong-example, if you're interested.

### Building and running

```
# Nothing to build -- all one simple script file.
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080 # Or similar
# Now visit localhost:8080/index.html in a browser.
```
